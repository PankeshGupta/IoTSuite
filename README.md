 A ToolSuite for Prototyping Internet of Things Applications
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
IoTSuite is a suite of tools for  developing Internet of  Things  applications. 
The main aim is of this toolkit is to reduce development efforts at various stages 
of  application development. For this,  It consists of the following components 
to aid stakeholders: 

* An **editor**  supports application design phase by allowing stakeholders 
to specify high-level specifications.

* A **compiler**  parses the high-level specification and supports the application development phase 
by producing programming framework that reduces development effort in specifying the details 
of components of an IoT application, 


* A **deployment module**  is supported by mapper and linker modules. They together  support 
 the deployment phase by producing device-specific code to result in a distributed 
 system collaboratively hosted by individual devices, and 

* A **runtime system**, which leverages existing middleware platforms and 
responsible for a distributed execution of an IoT application. 

The current implementation of IoTSuite targets both Android and JavaSE-enabled 
devices and MQTT middleware.
