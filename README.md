 # IoTSuite - A Toolkit for Prototyping Internet of Things Applications

IoTSuite is a suite of tools for  developing Internet of  Things  applications. 
The main aim is of this toolkit is to reduce development efforts at various stages 
of  application development. For this,  It consists of the following components 
to aid developers: 

* A **compiler**  parses the high-level specification and supports the application development phase 
by producing programming framework that reduces development effort in specifying the details 
of components of an IoT application.


* A **deployment module**  is supported by mapper and linker modules. They together  support 
 the deployment phase by producing device-specific code to result in a distributed 
 system collaboratively hosted by individual devices.

* A **runtime system**, which leverages existing middleware platforms and 
responsible for a distributed execution of an IoT application. 

The current version of IoTSuite supports several IoT technologies such as Android, 
 Raspberry PI, Arduino, and JavaSE-enabled devices, Messaging protocols such as MQTT, 
 CoAP, WebSocket, Server technologies such as Node.js,  Relational database such as MySQL, 
 and Microsoft Azure Cloud services.


## Getting Started

We provide IoTSuite in two versions: 

* **Developer version:** The aim of this version is to let developers to extend IoTSuite 
  with additional use cases. Therefore, we provide command-line interface and expose source code. 
  We highly recommend to use this version for research and experiment purposes.  
  
  For setup developer version - refer our [wiki pages](https://github.com/pankeshlinux/IoTSuite/wiki)

* **User version:** The aim of this version is to let users to develop IoT applications. 
  Therefore, we provide  editors (with Error checking, Syntax coloring and highlighting, 
  Code folding,  Outline/structured view etc.) as an interface to develop IoT. 
  The interface hides internal details from the users and let users to focus 
  on IoT application development. 
  
  To install user version - refer our [wiki pages](https://github.com/pankeshlinux/IoTSuite/wiki)
